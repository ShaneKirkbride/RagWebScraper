# RagWebScraper
 a full-stack prototype that combines the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), keyword-level sentiment analysis, and OpenAI summaries using C#, Blazor Server, and Qdrant. We ingest data from both URLs and PDF files, perform analysis, and allow users to query a semantic vector store in real time.
